# Build For Need

An interactive, responsive full-stack platform where everyday individuals (**Problem Sharers**) share authentic real-world dilemmas, and (**Developers**) specially beginners propose open-source websites, widgets, repositories, or scripts to solve them.

# Main Purpose 
***New developers often only create to-do list, calculator and weather app projects. And when they go for interviews in companies, the companies are not impressed with all these projects they see. They want new ideas and interesting projects.***

***Sometimes a project can be very interesting and very brilliant, but it does not solve any real problem in the real world or reality. So this website is for them.***

***Here, some people will share their problems. And developers, especially beginners, will create tools, websites or softwares or any projects to solve their problems for free. Thus, they can help people and they themselves can create an interesting and new brilliant project that can solve real world problems. This will also help them to build strong portfolio in LinkedIn.***

### Running Locally (Quick Start)
To launch the development suite on your local compiler:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Dev Environment**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This spins up the Express server on port `3000` executing Vite middlewares. Open `http://localhost:3000` to preview.

3. **Production Compilation**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Compiles static SPA assets and bundles the background script to `dist/server.cjs`.

4. **Production Start**:
